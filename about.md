### Me

Hey. I am a wana-be smart person.

### This blog

Yet another blog. I will write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas.
If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

My main interest is exploring how to think, and by extension, how machines should think.

The topics I will (probably) write about are machine learning and neural networks. Within that I am interested in;

* representation learning
* unsupervised and hebbian learning
* analysis of neural networks
* learning hyper-parameters
* adapting morphology of neural networks
* convolution and signals
* explanations and occams razor
* learning how to learn and meta cognition 

So pretty much anything related to consciousness, learning and intelligence.
