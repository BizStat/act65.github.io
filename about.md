### Me

The unifying theme across all my interests seems to be, **how to think**,and **what is the best way to think**? 


### This blog

Just another blog… I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas. If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

I think blogging/writing is a good way to analyse ideas, and to explore your own thoughts. In fact I encourage others to do the same, rather than spend time here…

This blog is hosted on github using jekyll so feel free to check it out. Also, it is super easy to create a blog, just fork [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository and start writing.

### Ratings
* 1 - Don’t waste your time. A mess of thoughts. Either trivial or erroneous.
* 2 - Surely you have better things to do? 
* 3 - Some good points in here, but they could be total crap.
* 4 - A good read. Educational and insightful.
* 5 - Stop what you are doing, and read this now, there is no time to waste.
