My name is Alex. I want to be smart(er). Blog posts will range from anything within;

___Brains, learning, languages, control, natural sciences, computation, math, optimisation, symmetry, entropy, ...___

This place for me to put the things I would like others to see; my notes and ideas about computer science and its applications. For the things I don’t want people to see, check out my other [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/). Which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal.

I simply forked this blog from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or [mine](https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io).
