This place for me to put some of the things I am actually a little proud of, for the other stuff check out [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/), which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal.

The posts will probably be anything related to brains, computers and math. I like thinking about how to think, how to solve problems, all that ‘meta’ stuff I wish I were better at.
