Just another blogâ€¦ I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas. If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

I seem to be interested in;
* how to think, and what is the best way to think? 
* and the relation between the structure of a system and its function.

I also keep another [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/), which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal. Feel free to check it out.
