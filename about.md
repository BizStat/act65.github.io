### About this blog

(under construction, although I doubt it will ever be finished...)

This place for me to put the things I want other people to see. For the things I don’t want people to see, check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/). Which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal.

### Interests

I keep [a collection of my interests](http://act65.github.io/interests/) (which should be reflected in the blog) for a couple of reasons; to try to find the patterns in my interests and to aid my memory...  In Dan Gilbert’s book, [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness), he points out that people are bad at knowing what makes them happy. Experience tells me I am no exception. This is an attempt to try to understand my interests.

### Jekyll

I simply forked this blog from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or [mine](https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io).
