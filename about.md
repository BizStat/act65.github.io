### Me

Hey, my name is Alex. I am currently studying a post grad diploma in computer science.

The unifying theme across all my interests seems to be, **how to think**. Thus the questions I am interested in are;

* what is thinking? Intelligence, creativity, learning, and consciousness.
* how do people think? Neuroscience and psychology.
* how (should) people think? The scientific method, metacognitive strategies and ??
* how (should) groups of people think? culture engineering, management and facilitation.
* how to do (good) research? 
* how (should) computers/structures think/function? Computer architectures, formal languages and artificial intelligence.
* how to learn? Machine learning and education.
* anything meta.
 
What is the best way to think?

### This blog

I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas.  (I think blogging/writing is a powerful method to aid the critical analysis of ideas and would encourage others to do the same.)

Otherwise, if others happen to learn from these posts awesome!
