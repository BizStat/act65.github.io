# About me

Hey, my name is Alex. When I am not getting distracted by life I like thinking about thinking, learning to learn, languages for languages, explaining explanation, science on science, solving problem-solving, and problem-solving problems, and all that meta stuff I wish I were better at. I also like thinking about which problems are important and why.

# About this blog

(under construction, although I doubt it will ever be finished...)

This place for me to put the things I want other people to see. For the things I don’t want people to see, check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/), which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal. Posts here will probably be related to cognition, computers, physics and math.


### Interests

I keep [this](http://act65.github.io/interests/) page for a couple of reasons; to try to find the patterns in my interests and to aid my memory...  In Dan Gilbert’s book, [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness), he points out that people are bad at knowing what makes them happy. Experience tells me I am no exception. This is an attempt to try to take a broader view of my interests and to try to keep up to date with them. A kind of study on myself.

### Questions

I have lots of [questions](http://act65.github.io/questions/) and most are promptly forgotten. Probably my favourite thing to do is to find topics/areas/questions/problems that are interesting and to ask the right questions. So this page just gives me a place to dump my random ideas, and to practice motivating and explaining them so they are accessible to others.

### Jekyll

I simply forked this blog from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or [my blog](https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io).
