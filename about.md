# About me

Hey, my name is Alex. I am a wanna-be researcher, maybe someday i’ll make it.

I like thinking about thinking, learning to learn, languages for languages, explaining explanation, science on science, solving problem-solving, and problem-solving problems, and thinking about which problems are important and why.

# About this blog

This place for me to put the things I want other people to see. For the things I don’t want people to see, check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/), which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal. Posts here will probably be related to cognition, computers, physics and math: mainly centered around neutral networks and deep learning.


### [Interests](http://act65.github.io/interests/)

I keep [this](http://act65.github.io/interests/) page for a couple of reasons; to try to find the patterns in my interests and . 

In Dan Gilbert’s book, [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness), he points out that people are bad at knowing what makes them happy. Experience tells me I am no exception. This is an attempt to try to take a broader view of my interests and to try to keep up to date with them. A kind of study on myself.


### [Questions](http://act65.github.io/questions/)

I have lots of ideas and never get around to many of them. Probably my favourite thing to do is to find areas that are interesting and to ask the right questions. It’s something about the potential that I enjoy. So this page just gives me a place to dump my random ideas, and to practice motivating and explaining them so they are accessible to others.

Some open problems I may get around to investigating/solving. The real goal here is to be able to motivate them properly.

In the unlikely case that someone actually listens to me: I take no responsibility for bad advice…

### Jekyll

I simply forked this blog from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or [my blog](https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io). Also, I welcome pull requests.
