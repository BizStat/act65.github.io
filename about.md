This place for me to put the things I want other people to see, for the things I donâ€™t want people to see, check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/) (which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal). In general, I like;
 
* thinking about thinking,
* learning to learn,
* thinking and learning,
* languages for languages,
* languages
* science on science,
* science,
* solving problem-solving, and problem-solving problems,
* thinking about which problems are important and why.

and all the other meta things I wish I were better at. But in reality, posts will probably be related to cognition, computers and math: mainly centered around neutral networks and deep learning.
