This place for me to put the things I want other people to see, for the things I donâ€™t want people to see check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/) (which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal).

The posts will probably be anything related to cognition, computers and math. I like;
 
* thinking about thinking,
* learning to learn,
* thinking and learning,
* science on science,
* science,
* thinking about how to solve problems, 
* thinking about which problems are important and why,
* designing new ways of thinking (languages).
