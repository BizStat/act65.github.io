### Me

Hey, my name is Alex. I am currently studying a post grad diploma in computer science, mainly focusing on neural networks. Who would want to do anything else?

The unifying theme across all my interests seems to be, **how to think**. And relatedly, **what is the best way to think**? For me, the _how to think_ is deeply tied to efficiency, but I don’t really know how.

Alternatively you could rephrase this as: how should a structure function (optimally) given an environment, problem and/or goal?

So, the questions I am interested in are;

* what is; intelligence, creativity, learning, and consciousness?
* how do people think? Neuroscience and psychology.
* how (should) people think? Philosophies and the scientific method, curiosity and play, metacognitive strategies and self-awareness, humility and cognitive biases, math and creativity… the list could go on and on. And on.
* how (should) groups of people think? Culture engineering, facilitation. (And to some extent politics and the structure of governments, but that seems like a hard problem with too many opinions and not enough facts)
* how to do (good) research? Falsification, collaboration, ??? 
* how (should) computers/structures think/function? Computer architectures, formal languages, artificial intelligence and neural networks!
* how to learn effectively? Machine learning and education.

### This blog

I write here to organise my thoughts, to practice explanations and to explore ideas. If others happen to learn from these posts awesome!

PS. I think blogging/writing is a good way to critically analyse ideas, and to explore your own thoughts. In fact I encourage others to do the same, rather than waste time here…

Ratings
* 1 - Don’t waste your time. A mess of thoughts. Either trivial or erroneous.
* 2 - Surely you have better things to do? 
* 3 - There might be a couple of good points in here, but I don’t garantee anything.
* 4 -
