This place for me to put the things I want other people to see, for the things I don’t want people to see, check out this [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/) (which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal). In general, I like;
 
* thinking about thinking,
* learning to learn,
* thinking and learning,
* languages for languages,
* languages
* explain explanation [David Deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=folTvNDL08A),
* science on science,
* science,
* solving problem-solving, and problem-solving problems,
* thinking about which problems are important and why.

and all the other meta things I wish I were better at. Aka, posts will probably be related to cognition, computers, physics and math: mainly centered around neutral networks and deep learning.

I keep my page on [interests](http://act65.github.io/interests/) to try to find the patterns in my interests. In my experience, people are poor at knowing what the like and what makes them happy (see Dan Gilbert’s [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness) for more info). So this is an attempt to try to take a broader view of my interests and to try to keep up to date with them.

I have lots of ideas and never get around to many of them. Probably my favourite thing to do is to find areas that are interesting and to ask the right questions. It’s something about the potential that I enjoy. So this page just gives me a place to dump my random ideas, and to practice motivating and explaining them so they are accessible to others.

In the unlikely case that someone actually listens to me. I take no responsibility for bad ideas taking years of work.
