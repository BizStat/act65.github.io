<div class="posts">
  
Some open problems I may get around to investigating/solving. Ideally these will turn into full blown projects, or quietly die (as it was probably a stupid ideaâ€¦). The real goal here is to be able to motivate them properly.
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.category contains "problem" %}

        <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h4>

    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
