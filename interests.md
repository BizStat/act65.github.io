The current questions that interest me. I hope that this page to be relatively dynamic over time.

*****

How fast is it possible to learn something? (lower bounds) How much do you have to search to find the best solution? Intelligence is the ability to solve problems efficiently! Active learning. Low-power learning. Memristors etc. Explorative search, 

How can you implement learning to learn? How can you learn to learn faster? Learn a convolution?

How can you augment an existing learning system to make is smarter? integrating with existing networks/systems. Transfer learning ... Continuous/on-line learning.

How can we learn good representations? How do we/nns understand things. Invariance and atomic. Universal languages. Semantics and grammar. How can we represent things in a way that allows us to do/understand (applied to people and computers).

Goal invariance

Constraining learning, weight tying, information propagation and types, higher-level structures.


Coordinating learning. Timing, ... Causality.  

Model based learning. Teaching processes. Learning/testing/correcting a part. Causality??

Compression as intelligence and consciousness. AIT.  Efficiency.  Compressing memories. RNNs as program compressors?

A way to understand the function of complex networks. To know how to networks are similar, what they share, how to morph one into the other, what structure one needs to do X function, ...

can we do as well or better than backprop through time (for training recurrent nets) with an efficient online algorithm (not requiring to store all our mental states for our lifetime and then play it backwards)?  Brains clearly achieve this feat but we have no clue how.

 What is the relation between structure/nature/functional and optimisation?

Memory. How do we decide what to remember? How can we store it efficiently, by picking out patterns, easy retrieval, ...

Building the perfect scientist. Querying the world, falsifying hypotheses
