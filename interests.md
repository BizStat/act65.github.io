`Still under construction`

If I had to sum up my interests in a sentence it would be something like:

> What is the best way to think? 

Where _'best'_ means, most efficient, most effective, ... ? and where _'think'_ is a synonym for compute, ...?

# Languages: structure and function

How does
I want a way to be able to look at the rules/syntax/... of some structure and to be able to tell you what it will do, how it will function. (???) 
What is the best way to think about some thing? Generally, using some language that reflects the true structure. 

* Why are tensors such an effective language for thinking about structure in systems? What would a non-linear and differentiable language for structure look like? What language would allow me to differentiably learn a convolution?
* What is the right language for describing systems of loss functions, optimisers and agents? How should they be composed and decomposed?
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/), ... This is what AI will look like for the foreseeable future, better tools, manifesting as programs and programming languages. What makes these languages effective and useful? The small wins of incremental improvements in efficiency (by adding more biases, speciality and heuristics)?
* Graphical models (of computation) where gradients and/or uncertainty can flow along edges and between nodes. (loss functions propagated between optimisers?)
* (Programming) Languages. Lambda calculus, ...??? Functional programming ??? Compliers and ???
* What does the english language reflect about how we think, and how does the english language effect the way we think? Why is english such a successful language for communication, reason and ___ ? 
* Why should we build some languages based on set theory and others on type theory?
* Compilers.

# Physics, optimisation and computers

Given that we live in a universe governed by physics. How does that determine the things that are possible, and what are the limits?
What questions can we answer? 

* Computer architectures. Von Neumann, neuromorphic, photonic, micro-fluid, biological, 
* Variational calculus and optimisation. Connections to dynamical systems.
* Does $P = NP$? This is one of my favourite questions as it is really asking deep physics questions. What is possible given the physics of our universe?  Will our problems always be hard to solve/learn?
* Foundations. Godel's incompleteness, turing's halting, ???, EWA
* Computer architectures, ... Neuromorphic engineering. 
* Physically inspired algoriths. Learning as diffusion.[]()
* Quantum computing.
* How does this relate to non-convex optimisation?

##### Efficiency, compression and entropy

> Intelligence is the ability to solve problems efficiently

How fast is it possible to learn something? What are the limits to how much you can learn given that we live in a world governed by physics? Similarly, how fast can you optimise a function?

Active learning. 

Low-power learning and spiking, lazy evaluation, ‘just in time’ processing. Outsourcing memory to the environment, and predicting informations availability to save resources.

Attention!! Anomaly, salience, novelty, residual errors from generative models, 

Compression as intelligence and consciousness. AIT.  Efficiency.  Compressing memories. RNNs as program compressors? Following gradients of __?

# Deep learning

* The brain implements specialised optimisers [Integration of DL and neuro... -- Marblestone](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03813). How can we learn these specialised systems? How can you learn to learn? [Learning to learn -- Andrychowicz](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474)
* How can we compose and manage neural networks? What if I want to make a net to make a net? Modular nets. A language .. .? How can neural nets learn to generate other networks? How about learning to manipulate function handles, where the handles are other neural nets?
* Replace everything with neural networks. Adam, don’t need that, let a NN do it. 
* A way to understand the function of complex networks. To know how to networks are similar, what they share, how to morph one into the other, what structure one needs to do X function, ...
* How can we learn good representations? How do we/nns understand things. Invariance and atomic. Universal languages. Semantics and grammar. How can we represent things in a way that allows us to do/understand (applied to people and computers). Disentangled!! Causal.
* RL?!? Decision making? Gradient estimation.
* Exploding/vanishing gradients, internal covariance shift, catastrophic interference and continuous learning, curse of dimensionality

##### Memory and unsupervised learning

Memory. How do we decide what to remember? How can we store it efficiently, by picking out patterns, easy retrieval, ...

Unsupervised learning!
* Self-supervision and context.
* Generative models.

Prediction!

##### Teaching

How can you augment an existing learning system to make is smarter? integrating with existing networks/systems. Transfer learning ... Continuous/on-line learning.

How to teach? Curriculum learning? Bootstrapping loss functions, … ???
Process learning

Model based learning. Teaching processes. Learning/testing/correcting a part. Causality??

Education.

### Distributed systems

How can we coordinate multiple learners/agents? 
What happens if they process things at different speeds, how can we assign credit? Timing, ... causality.  

A distributed learning algorithm?!?
Learning to communicate?

Can we do as well or better than backprop through time (for training recurrent nets) with an efficient online algorithm (not requiring to store all our mental states for our lifetime and then play it backwards)?  Brains clearly achieve this feat but we have no clue how. TD learning? 

Group management?

### Wetware and all that  

The most complex systems we know of, us. Genetics, epigenetics, synthetic biology, neuroscience.  How are we designed and managed? What biases and heuristics are preprogrammed within us? What is the minimal set of assumptions/heuristics to lead to intelligence?

The brain. How does it work!?!?! [Surfing uncertainty -- Andy Clark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25823558-surfing-uncertainty) Is consciousness just an illusion? The result of our brains trying to predict the world, and yet living within the world.

Viewing the brain as a system of agents who compete for cognitive resources, barter for information (to remove uncertainty), ???

### The scientific method

Building the perfect scientist. Querying the world, falsifying hypotheses. Prediction and action.
Causality. Counterfactuals.
