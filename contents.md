Other than the main feed, there are a couple of different sections on this site.


# Basics

<!--TODO Insert text from readme.-->

<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.category contains "basics" %}
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

# Motivations

There are popular and successful approaches that already exist. Why are they popular, what problems do they solve, why do we bother?

Ultimately, I would like to answer: what computational problem does ________ solve?

<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.category contains "answer" %}
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

# Thoughts, notes and ideas

<!--TODO Insert text from readme.-->


<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.category contains "notes" %}
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

# Summaries

Each weekend I am going to summarise a paper that interests me. They will probably be related to memory, learning and/or reasoning.

I want to write some summaries for a couple of reasons.

* Having a collection of papers I have read and analysed makes me feel good.
* These summarise act as a metric for progress and improvement.
* To hone the skill of reading a paper. (picking out the important details, and the ones they left out, â€¦?)
* It helps me focus (which I struggle with).


<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.category contains "summary" %}
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <br>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
