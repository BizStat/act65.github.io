<!-- TODO. dont have the relevant knowledge for this. -->

## Motivation.


## Path

VR headsets and consoles for gaming -> Contact lens and non-invasive recording (EEG/MEG/minituraised PET) -> Retinal and neuro-subdermal implants -> ? -> mind-uploading.
(Cloud) computation services. Grow cerebral organiods -> Figure out how they learn -> Train them to solve problems -> Integrate them with computers -> mind-uploading.
Cybernetic implants for the physically disabled  -> 
Next gen phone/?. Google in your head.
Nanotech. -> 
Personal imaging. Store memories.
?

Little drawings of these would be cooler?
