> What important problems are you working on? [Richard Hamming](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html)

I would like to answer a slightly different question; what problems do you think are important? (the problems I wish I was working on…)

Why do I think posing problems is important? 
What is a problem in this context?

Deepest problems? (with NNs)
* Catastrophic interference
* Exploding/vanishing gradients
* Learning to augment NN topology
* Disentangled representations

Setting problems
* Partial observations
* Bandits (independent reward/feedback-action pairs)
* 


# Catastrophic interference

Is …

Related to - multi-task learning, transfer learning, goal invariance, 

# Exploding/vanishing gradients

Is …

Related to;
* BIG data
* SGD
* sparse rewards

RNNs and RL


# New problems?

* Learning how to think (see []()) rather than what to think.
*
