> What important problems are you working on? [Richard Hamming](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html)

I would like to answer a slightly different question; what problems do you think are important? (the problems I wish I was working onâ€¦)

Why do I think posing problems is important? 

For each I aim to describe the;
* problem (high level),
* a metaphorical example,
* a formal definition,
* and a suggested benchmark/challenge/toy problem.
