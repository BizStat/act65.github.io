> What important problems are you working on? [Richard Hamming](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html)

I would like to answer a slightly different question; what problems do you think are important? (the problems I wish I was working onâ€¦)

Why do I think posing problems is important? 

For each I aim to describe the;
* problem (high level),
* a metaphorical example,
* a formal definition,
* and a suggested benchmark/challenge/toy problem.

### Continuous learning

This idea is an extension of online learning. The setting is that, not only 
???

### Model-based learning

### Representation learning

### Coordinated learning (see [this]() post for more details)

### Active learning

# Learning sequences
### Curriculum learning

Start with the easy things first and build on them. (do they actually get it to compose later ideas from earlier ones?)

### Apprentice learning

Witnessing a series of sub-optimal demonstrations may be enough 

### Process learning

A special case of apprentice learning?
