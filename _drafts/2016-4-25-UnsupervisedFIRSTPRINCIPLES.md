# What is it?

Definitions;

* The opposite of supervised learning.
* clustering. (clustering what?)
* 



# Why bother?

> Every second the world is telling you how it works. You just need to listen.

# Strategies for unsupervised learning

Reconstruct. 
Whether from;
* the original to 
* a partial/context 
* 

# Examples

## Data


##Algorithms
### Representation
* Autoencoders.
* Word2vec.
### Predictive
* 


I think that we make a mistake when we expect our algorithms to be able to learn from unlabelled data. The mistake is that we assume … they are like us??  with wanting algorithms to learn from unlabelled data, with no assumptions… We bring in large amount of knowledge and heuristics/assumptions with us when we solve a new problem.

The only way to do unsupervised learning without assumptions is ??? NP? Brute force?

Transfer learning! Knowledge representation/modelling.

How do people learn without supervision. They leverage past supervised learning??

We need a metric to measure the effectiveness of an unsupervised learner.
