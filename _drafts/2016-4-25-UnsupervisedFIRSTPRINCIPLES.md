What is it?

I think that we make a mistake when we expect our algorithms to be able to learn from unlabelled data. The mistake is that we assume …??  with wanting algorithms to learn from unlabelled data, with no assumptions… We bring in large amount of knowledge and heuristics/assumptions with us when we solve a new problem.

Transfer learning! Knowledge representation/modelling.
