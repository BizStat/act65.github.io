Relationship between;
nilpotent duals, automatic differentiation, functional programming, sonnet, FAT, linear algebra.

Let \mathcal F be the set of quads.
Define f \in /mathcal F such that;
$$
\exists f^{-1}: f^{-1} \circ f \approx identity \
\exists \nabla f:
\exists \nabla f^{-1}:
$$


if we want do some algebra with these things we need a richer type system!
important types;
* maps to same dimensionality
* orthogonal transform
* ?
