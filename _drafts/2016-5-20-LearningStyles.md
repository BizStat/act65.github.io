A survey of ???
For each I aim to describe the;
* problem (high level),
* a metaphorical example,
* a formal definition,
* and a suggested benchmark/challenge/toy problem.

### Continuous learning

This idea is an extension of online learning. The setting is that, not only 
???

### Model-based learning

### Representation learning

### Coordinated learning (see [this]() post for more details)

### Active learning

### Transfer learning

and its relation to generalisation?

what to transfer? meta-transfer - only info about how to search/learn faster, not domain specific. but if it isn’t domain specific have we really learnt anything? is it possible to be 100% general??

### Metalearning

Learning to learn

# Learning sequences
### Curriculum learning

Start with the easy things first and build on them. (do they actually get it to compose later ideas from earlier ones?)

### Apprentice learning

Witnessing a series of (sub-optimal) demonstrations may be enough … (rich examples).

### Process learning

A special case of apprentice learning? For sequences?
What if we had better teachers? Ones that told you where you went wrong.
What if we tried to predict where we think we went wrong/right?
