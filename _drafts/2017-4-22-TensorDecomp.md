### Neural networks



### Tensor decompositions

Cohen et al...

# Types of decompositions

* Rank decompositions
  * HOSVD (high order SVD)
  * HSVD (hierarchical SVD)
* Parition decompositions
  * ? need to name it?
  *
* ? QR, cholesky, ... shur, ?!??

### Mixture of experts -> heirarchical lsh

What is the relation to tensor networks?
pic.

### Value table look-up

Have an exponential (in what) size space. But there is a large amuont of structure.
Decompose the space/tensor into ...



the image in my head. as a fiber connecting two points in an exp large space!?
