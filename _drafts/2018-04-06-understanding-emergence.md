> How does complexity emerge out of simplicity?

- Given a small code, our genome (on the order of kB), how is such complexity generated?
- Given a simple loss function how it can bootstrap itself to generate specialised experts? ... through meta learning?
- Why does the humble natural selection algorithm generate the splendid diversity we see around us?

How can a simple reward function (such as fitness, value prediction, compression) generate diversity and complexity?

#### Other possible tools?

Approaches to study this problem.
<!-- (want feedback from david here!!) -->



- Use bprop to estimate the effect of parameters/assumptions!?
- How easily does the phenomena emerge?
- ablation studies to prove necessity?!?
- Bifurications?!?
- Category theory - generative composition
- ?
- tools from many-body particle physics? phases and crystals?
- Relation to combinatorics?
- ?

#### Disentanglement

What about the dual problem? What can reduction and disentanglement of complex  system teach us about generating complex systems?

## Questions to answer

- the duality of dynamical systems and optimisation (what is a dynamical system optimsing, what is the optimisers dynamics?)
- How does a simple loss lead to complexity? Recursively applying the same target, boostrapping off itself, ...?
- ?
