What makes a good explanation? And what would happen if we could explain the universe in a theory of everything?

Inspired by [The beginning of infinity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity?from_search=true&search_version=service) by David Deutsch.

# Good explanations

What makes a good explanation? 

* Being able to make accurate predictions.
* Being able to use small amounts of information (elegance).
* General. Specific. Minimal. Accurate. no these are what makes a good prediction

What if I could explain everything? And do it with only a single short explanation. Like a theory of everything.

# 

What happens at the max/min? Where we have all information, represented in a minimally sized integrated structure.

Is this similar to what evolution is trying to do (minimising conceptual complexity through energy efficiency, and maximising integrated information through memory and experience)? 
Is this similar to what physicists are trying to do (one equation to describe everything)?

# A fundamental limit?

It stuck me that our search for a theory of everything is somewhat similar to asking, does our universe have a shorter description? So currently, the evolution of the universe in time is perfectly predicted by the universes’ current state (although some/many/all quantum physicists may argue?). If we found a theory of everything that could predict the universes evolution in time with perfect accuracy then we 
 
* Can you simulate a turning machine with a turing machine?
* Can you get a turing machine to simulate itself?
* Given this shorter description, have we then created a universe within a universe? 
* Is the description of something the same as the thing itself?
* Is our universe reducible? Could it be represented with less?
* Is our universe is a computation? To see whether it can be represented in a shorter description?
* Does this make the end of our universe undecidable, like the halting problem? 

Seems like there is some underlying contradiction/paradox?
