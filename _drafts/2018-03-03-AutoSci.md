## Motivation

> Automated science and math.

Math and science have become too big for individuals. We find it hard to keep up and to cram the relevant knowledge into our small heads. We need better tools to continue push the boundaries.

## Ultimate goal

I can imagine a future where Google, AllenAI, Baidu, ... are all publishing research. However, this research isnt being done by people, but by algorithms. These algols have read millions of papers and constructed mega-knowledge bases. They use models of the world (their KB?) to predict data and ...

## What makes it hard?

Need;

* 

## Toy problems/practical steps forward

Entity resolution for topics


## Experiments in the real world

Needs to be able to reproduce! Thus it will need to be able to run experiments.
But which ones? Some are costly, some are dangerous, and some might not tell us much.

## The highest impact

Given a broad view of research (which may be possible for computers), which directions/theories/... are most promising.
Ability to reason about known-unknowns. And systematically explore unknown-unknowns.

Not only do we

## applications

* consulting scientist; we need a new drug that can do XX, can you find us one?
* automated journal;
