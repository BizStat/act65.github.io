title: Higher level control
---

I think I have noticed a pattern in the problems posed by active, continuous and ‘process’ learning (see [this]() post for more details).

They all seem to need a higher level controller (high net), preferably a network that also learns, that can augment the topology of the network doing the heavy lifting (low net).

How would this high net augment the low nets structure. It seems to me that many of the changes in thoughts we have are quite discontinuous…

Instead it could be more like a switch board? Subnetworks for types of problem, or for representations?

The high net needs to know what each subnet does.
