### Binary search

Let's search a set for an item. We assume that we have a binary operator that always divides the set of items in half. An example of such an operator could be: picking the mid point of a sorted list of our set elements.

Need two operators: halving and equality.

Traditionally you will see the binary search algorithm written something like this.

```python
def binarySearch(alist, item):
    midpoint = len(alist)//2
        if alist[midpoint]==item:
            return True
        else:
            if item<alist[midpoint]:
                return binarySearch(alist[:midpoint],item)
            else:
                return binarySearch(alist[midpoint+1:],item)
```


```python
Experts = Init()              #A list of numbers

for iter in range(iterations):
    #x = observe()             
    y = [for expert in Experts] 
    prediction = round(sum(y)/N)
    target = 
```

### Thoughts

* The sorted list is super important? Depending on how you represent you data means different operators are (not) feasible.
* Should I go into merge, bubble, ...search???
