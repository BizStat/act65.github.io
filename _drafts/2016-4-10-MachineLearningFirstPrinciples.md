title: Machine intelligence from first principles
---

So what do I think is necessary and sufficient for artificial intelligence?

What does it mean to __learn__? What is __intelligence__? What is __creativity__? What is __consciousness__?

* I think intelligence is: the ability to solve problems efficiently. How efficiently? Or is it a scale? (thus it is deeply related to the ability to learn)
* 

**Necessary**

* You cannot be artificially intelligence without being efficient. 



**Sufficient**


*****

* Having model-free representations of ... Aka heuristics, intuition, ... 
* Having model-based representations of ...
