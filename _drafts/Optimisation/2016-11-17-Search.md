### Binary search

Let's search a set for an item. We assume that we have a binary operator that always divides the set of items in half. An example of such an operator could be: picking the mid point of a sorted list of our set elements.

Need two operators: halving and equality.

Traditionally you will see the binary search algorithm written something like this.

```python
def binarySearch(alist, item):
    midpoint = len(alist)//2
        if alist[midpoint]==item:
            return True
        else:
            if item<alist[midpoint]:
                return binarySearch(alist[:midpoint],item)
            else:
                return binarySearch(alist[midpoint+1:],item)
```


```python
Experts = Init()              #A list of numbers

for iter in range(iterations):
    #x = observe()             
    y = [for expert in Experts] 
    prediction = round(sum(y)/N)
    target = 
```

# Sorting

Why is sorting so tightly linked to searching? Sorting organises the data in specific ways. More broadly we could include hashing, ???? under this definition.

What organisational structures are best for;

* quick indexing, writing, reading, ???
* giving us lots of info about neighbors
* generalising

How does structure aid search?

### Merge sort

A nice recursive implementation.

### Thoughts

* The sorted list is super important? Depending on how you represent you data means different operators are (not) feasible.
* Should I go into merge, bubble, ... sort???
