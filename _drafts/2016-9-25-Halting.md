title: Halt!

Most people have heard of the halting problem. It says... This bugged me for a while, because I felt like I could look at a program and tell you whether I thought it would halt. 

I am interested in how different models of computation keep giving the same result, indicating that the halting problem is not just a property of any …

So, how else can we prove the halting problem, and using which models of computation? (side note, which models are the best? — best being defined however you like)

Turing, (Algorithmic) Information theory (?), Lambda calc, Godel and algebra, LinAlg, EWA, ?(my own creation?)
