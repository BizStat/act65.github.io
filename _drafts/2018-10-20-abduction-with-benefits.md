title: The advantage of abduction?
---

What can reasoning via abdction provide that deduction cannot?
(refering to abduction to mean reasoning from effects to causes)

Imagine you are an agent in a 2d environment. Lets discretise the space for simlicity, he grid graph in n dimensions.

However, rather than having access to the usual euclidean metric, you have nothing.
You are tasked with getting from A to B.

This is a common situation in the RL setting. The learner does not know how its actions move it around the space it is in, and it does not know which actions will lead to a reward.
