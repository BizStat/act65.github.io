Meta- cognition, reasoning, memory, knowledge, problem-solving, creativity, awareness, decision-making, reflection, planning, regulation, emotion, meta…

What do there really mean? And how is current research related to these problems? I will attempt to do a quick survey of meta-cognitive processes while interpreting them in terms of machine learning/artificial intelligence. 


What should meta-cognitive processes be doing? They should be trying to learn/evaluate/answer;

##### 1. what information is useful for (learning to) do X?

Probably the most …?
active learning) … links
or even more generally, what are the most useful type of information.

I like to think of this one as building the perfect scientist. We have a bunch of hypotheses and we need to test them. How do we do this before the universe ends and with $20? We need to select the most likely hypotheses (via Occams razor?) and then pick tests (that use few resources - quickly and cheaply) that can falsify them. 

But what allocated our resources?? I.e. how much time should we spend falsifying hypotheses rather than 

what about __how to find__ what information is useful for (learning to) do X?

##### 2. how I should learn from information I have?

As far as I have seen this doesn’t exist in ML/AI research. - 
* adaptive optimisation?
* learning the loss function?
* 

This one should be named meta-learning?


##### 3. what do I think I know?

How well do you know 

This is actually a (sub) field of cognitive science/psychology itself, called meta-memory.




##### 4. how well I think I will do at solving X and how well I think I have done at solving X?

I think there is an important distinction between these two meta-cognitive process.

The first process requires you to make many assumptions, with little processing, and to imagine how you would solve the problem.

blah blah

*****

The second requires you to imagine alternative strategies of solving the problem and weigh the strategy you used against others. Typically I think we would call this certainty. So, I am saying, that when we say we are certain, we mean that: given plausible alternative strategies to solve the problem (that were available in memory) we think they would have resulted in the same/a similar conclusion.

Interestingly, we (well, at least some of us - not necessarily including me…) can turn this process inward and use it to evaluate whether our beliefs are right. This reminds me of functional programming, in the sense that our thought processes are first class objects. Aka they can be subjected to the same meta-cognitive processes.


##### 5. what experiences/memories are important?

Our brains use emotions to help us tag important memories, for some this is events related to good friendships and others this might be good test grades. 

This one is hard, it’s deeply tied to goals/loss functions and reinforcement learning. The experiences/memories that are important are generally the ones that help you achieve what you want. But typically achieving what you want is sparse and discrete (aka within a RL setting). Also, this would require some understanding of causality, and a some time dependent model to capture the relations between actions/events and rewards. Ok, this one is really hard…

However, if we viewed this in the simpler supervised setting of image classification, we would want to remember actions/events that reduced the loss by the greatest amounts.

What about finding patterns in these important memories ???
How closely related is this to 1? 

##### 6. what details can I discard/merge/abstract?

So, how can we compress our memories so that we retain all the ‘important’ information 
I don’t know who was first to pose this idea, but I have heard/read Schmidhuber pushing it and this paper []().

Compressing these means finding patterns, which is !!!. 



*****

I am sure there are more meta-cognitive processes going on up there. Let me know if you can think of any.

Other I couldn’t pin down.
