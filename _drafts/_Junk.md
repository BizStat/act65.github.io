Alternatively you could rephrase this as: how should a structure function (optimally) given an environment, problem and/or goal?

So, the questions I am interested in are;

* what is; intelligence, creativity, learning, and consciousness?
* how do people think? Neuroscience and psychology.
* how (should) people think? Philosophies and the scientific method, curiosity and play, metacognitive strategies and self-awareness, humility and cognitive biases, math and creativityâ€¦ the list could go on and on. And on.
* how (should) groups of people think? Culture engineering, facilitation. (And to some extent politics and the structure of governments, but that seems like a hard problem with too many opinions and not enough facts)
* how to do (good) research? Falsification, collaboration, ??? 
* how (should) computers/structures think/function? Computer architectures, formal languages, artificial intelligence and neural networks!
* how to learn effectively? Machine learning and education.
