subtitle: The dangers of getting caught up in short term goals that you don’t even care that much about.

I am quickly realising the dangers of academic research;
* getting caught up in the latest fad (resents at the moment),
* the want to get you name on some papers (I am still unpublished),
* 

and because of this, I haven’t had time for some (arguably my best/biggest) ideas.

* Is there a way to interpret neural networks with math from dynamical systems and control theory?
	* How is stability related to uncertainty in networks? 
	* Can generative adversarial networks be modelled as a two variable dynamical system?
* Investigating a formal language for thinking about how the structure of neural networks relates to their function. 
	* Functional matrices and tensors.
* Investigating the relation between algorithmic information theory, recurrent neural networks and the compression of programs.
* Spending time thinking about better optimisation and learning rules.
	* Active learning.
	* Hyper-parameter optimisation, and recursive optimisation.
	* Alternatives to stochastic gradient descent.
