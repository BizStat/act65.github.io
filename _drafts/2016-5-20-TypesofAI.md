title: Types of AI
---

So, I have been trying to think about what we (AI/ML researchers) are aiming for, and I had some trouble coming up with clear answers. So …

Define AI.


# Types
* Human-like
* Scientist-like (they aren’t really humans)
* Machine-like
* ???

Distributed consciousness? Goal driven? Attention/priorities?


## Human-like AI

Popular ideas - Her, Ex Machina, …
Models of the brain - Blue brain projects …

## Scientist-like

Seeks to find an accurate model of the world.

Versions
* passively observes the world and forms a model. It’s goal is to make accurate predictions.
* actively queries the world and designs experiments to increase its ability to make accurate predictions. Queries and experimental designs could be filtered through humans. (this sounds kind of similar to what we do now? supervised learning the queries, which already exist are filtered through humans…)



## Already?

Thermostat? Self-driving cars …


# Goals?

* Truth
	* Accurate models/predictions
	* 
* Compression
* Make people happy (… lame)
