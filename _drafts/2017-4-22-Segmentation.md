Spatial transformer -> deformable -> drawing polygons!

### What loss makes sense?



### What vs where. Can share params?

A: Which features did you use to classify x?
B: Which features contain x?

Intuitively A is a subset of B, but it is also possible to use c not in B to help classify x. E.g. negative examples. It's not a cat therefore it's a dog.


### Unsupervised segmentation

Relation to ICA and blind source separation?
Difference between segmentation and separation?

Object, instance, semantic. Just pixel wise labels?!
