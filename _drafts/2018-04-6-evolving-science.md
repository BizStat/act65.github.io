title: Evolving scientific models
---

Science by first principles/simulation. 

I see some similarities in the methodology (I would want to use) to understand cooperation/trading/specialisation and to understand the brains structure.


Show that: optimising a reward, in different environments (aka under different constraints/assumptions) various strategies (memory, safe trade, ...) emerge naturally.

Other ways of stating the same thing;
- Show which environments provide advantages to different strategies when optimising for the same goal.
- Show what is necessary/sufficient for a certain phenomena to emerge

Other possible tools?
- Use bprop to estimate the effect of parameters/assumptions!?
- How easily does the phenomena emerge?
- ablation studies to prove necessity?!?

Problems with this approach;
- a trajectory/generative reward only proves sufficiency.
- ?

What is necessary to build an explanation?
Generative. Each part is necessary. 

This is just the same as all science? Build a model!?! But the how is the important part. 
- Reduce to simple testable cases.
- Build up complexity
- Figure out which assumptions are necessary and cut others. Compress!!


What about if we viewed the evolution of theories of gravity a similar way?!? Always optimising accuracy.
First the easily solutions are found and constrained by data. 
- Speed of light is necessary for relativity.
- ?
