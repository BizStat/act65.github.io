title: Roadmaps to brain uploading
---

Motivation. Need a path, with small (incremental) steps towards mind-uploading. Why?

Need funding. If we can commercialise products along the way, the project can fund itself making it sustainable.
Reality checks. Rather than shooting for an overly ambitious goal, or a potentially flawed approach we want to prototype and test as we go.
Potential pathways.

VR headsets and consoles for gaming -> Contact lens and non-invasive recording (EEG/MEG/minituraised PET) -> Retinal and neuro-subdermal implants -> ? -> mind-uploading.
(Cloud) computation services. Grow cerebral organiods -> Figure out how they learn -> Train them to solve problems -> Integrate them with computers -> mind-uploading.
Cybernetic implants for the physically disabled  -> 
Next gen phone/?. Google in your head.
Nanotech. -> 
Personal imaging. Store memories.
?

Little drawings of these would be cooler?
