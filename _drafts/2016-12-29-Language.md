Desiderata

* Differentiable everything. (aka chain rule through everything)
  * Compiler, multiple dispatch, types,
* Fast linear algebra. (aka ?)
  * Use low rank approximations
  * Compute with factorisations in some lower dim space.
  * Built into core of hardware.
* Sharing is natural and easy.
* Natural language interface.
* Can compile commands at run time (aka can receive commands and run them during
  execution. aka multi agent)

# Base
### Base language - Linear algebra

Whole thing is written in linear algebra. (using logic embedded in linalg).
So we can differentiate it, but still remain efficient by interpreting logic as just
sparse matrices?

### Base DS

This is important. How do we want to represent this stuff?
* Am I sure I want to base it in linalg?
* I would like graph representations to feel natural.
*

# Core
### Differentiable

* We could insert parameters here and there? But where???
  * At routers for multiple dispatch?
  * At nodes that
*

***
### What is this language for?

* Learning, reasoning, memory, attention, creativity,
What do we need for these?
