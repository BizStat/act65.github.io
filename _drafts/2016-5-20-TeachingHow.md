title: Teaching machines how to think
---

How should a student learn? And how should a teacher teach?

(insert some snappy name)

Supervised learning. Do as I tell you. Copy me. Is this really how we should be training (and/or thinking) about learning?

Why do humans (at least the intelligent ones) succeed at learning? Explanations, causes. They learn how to think, via culture, teachers, languages (math) â€¦

* How can we teach machines to think?
* What does supervised learning look like when we supervise their thought process rather than their output? (similar in some ways to Neural Programmer-Interpreter version of curriculum learning)
