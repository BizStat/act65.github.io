Make lots of predictions. Aka TD learning. Every step try in you computation, try to predict something local.(yes it is cool that every thing can be parallelised, and â€¦) 


How can we be wrong faster/earlier? When training with TD we need to wait for error signals to slowly filter back through our ???. 


Would this allow us to adapt faster? Can we prove it?
