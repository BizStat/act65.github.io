title: What symmetries are there in computational problems?
category: problem
rating: 1

How does the structure of a problem determine the structure of efficient solutions? How do efficient solutions reflect the structure of the problem they were designed to solve? What symmetries are there between them? How does structure (of a solution/algorithm) determine fuction (the problems it can solve)? Function is structure!

Images are naturally invariant to translation (and some other variables - rotations, size, colour...) and convolutions are commonly used for images, why? Because if we could imagine the transformations done by convolutions as some sort of structue we would see that they are invariant to translation.



### Thoughts
* Is there a better way to measure the amount of computation required?
* How can we represent algorithms as structures? 
    * What symmetries do these structures have? 
    * Do all NP-complete problems share the same symmetries?   
* Can we relate these symmetries to something like group theory? Alternatively, what properties are conserved?
