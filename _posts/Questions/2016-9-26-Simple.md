title: How can you objectively measue which hypothesis is simpler?

Classic induction. Many different hypotheses can explain the data we have seen. How can we deal with this problem?

* Bayesian approahces say dont pick, but rather ...
* Neural networks say ...

We really want a way to use occams razor to pick the simplest hypothesis. But what makes a simple hypothesis, it depends on which language it is frame in. (Blue vs grue...)

Ideally kolmogorov complexity could be used to measure the complexity of each of our canidate hypotheses and used to select the simplest. However, kolmogorov complexity is not computable as we don't know the universal language (needs more explanation). 

Hold that thought.

The Church-Turing thesis states that all computational models are equivalent (up to some polynomial slow down). But which model is the best model? An elegant answer is that physics is the universal language. Aka the Church-Turing-Deutsch thesis.

So, can we do the same with kolmogorov complexity? The simplest hypothesis could be quantified using kolmogorov complexity where physics is the universal language.
