title: Why is linear algebra soo powerful?

Why is linear algebra such an effective language for thinking about and expressing structure in systems? 


What would a non-linear and differentiable language for structure look like? What language would allow me to differentiably learn, say, a convolution? 

What alternatives are there to representing information that rival linear algebra? 


### Applications

Why is this cool? It is a general way to represent things. The power comes from it ability to make different operators by simply chaging structure?

##### Dual numbers

$$
\begin{align}
a + b\epsilon \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
0 & a \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

##### Complex numbers

$$
\begin{align}
a + b i \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
-b & a \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

##### Logic and (quantum) computation


$$
\begin{align}
CNOT \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$
