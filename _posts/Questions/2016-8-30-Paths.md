title: Are paths fundamental to understanding neural nets?
category: problem

The number of paths in a neural net increase exponentially in depth, but not in width. (I think) the number of additional operations (ie from the matmuls) remains the same for both. It would be nice to relate the number of paths to expressive power, i.e. something like [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03965).
