Distributed optimisation is the solution! The solution to what?

### What is distributed optimisation?

Distributed optimisation is not distributed processing (or can we relax this?).

Types of distributed optimisation? Collaborative (and thus specialist?), versus ?. 

### The problem?

Setting: 

* real time response/online learning, thus requiring parallel/distributed processing for any real world problem (?)
* the agents of parallel/distributed system need to communicate large amount of information
* multiple objectives, that update in an asynchronous manner?

### Real world examples/applications

* ?!?
