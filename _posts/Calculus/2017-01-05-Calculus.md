## Finite differences

Want to

Alternative derivation/framing?

Connected neighbors. Approximation given local behaviour.

[intuition]({{ baseurl }}/)

which leads to empirical calculation of gradients.


## Temporal differences.

Credit assignment in ML.
How is it used. What does it do. Local credit assignment.
Making it efficient? AD?

## Automatic differentiation

Forward and reverse AD.
Relation to symbolic gradients.
Relation to duals.([doubly recursive gist](gist) and )

[implementation of AD](gist)
Incremental lambda calculus.

## Non-differentiable

### Solutions. GA, RL.

Problem Credit assignment

### Settings

* discrete (soft approximations)
* random (mean field).
* unknown (Balduzzi on approximation gradient fns)



solutions?

concrete distribution. ...
MCMC of counterfactuals?
