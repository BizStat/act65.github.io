title: Axioms of linear algebra
---

1. Associativity of addition
* Commutativity of addition
* Identity element of addition
* Inverse elements of addition
* Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition
* Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition
* Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication
* Identity element of scalar multiplication

Translating this into something more interpretable?

==??
So these axioms are what allow matmul to work like it does?
What if LinAlg wasnt associative, or commutative, or ... Find counter examples?!?
