<!-- Options.
* Cover linalg but start from the composition of linear functions?
* Make up some other basis of linear maps that satisfies the axioms.
* derive linalg from different axioms?

Linear algebra is the basis of ...
A nice quote?

* [?](??) diy version

## First class vectors

the weird/awesome fact that a linear transformation/function is just an array.
So both objects and morphisms can be represented by the same structure, given
a process for combining them. (or is that process the morphism?)
