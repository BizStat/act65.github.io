title: Paths in linear networks
category: problem
---

The number of paths (from [Gated games](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01952) and [Loss surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0233)) in a net increase exponentially in depth, but not in width. (I think) the number of additional operations (ie from the matmuls) remains the same for both. It would be nice to relate the number of paths to expressive power, i.e. something like [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03965).

I donâ€™t think it makes much sense to think about the paths in a linear net as they all just collapse back down to a single layer, so the number of paths is somewhat irrelevant. But I think that using complex numbers may change this??? (Like how some two-qubit states - described by complex numbers - can't be written as the tensor product of one-qubit states, e.g. the EPR pair).  Something about the way complex numbers can constructively/destructively interfere. 

This relies on $\forall A,B \in \mathbb R^{n_i,n_j} \exists C : A\cdot B = C$ but if $A,B \in \mathbb C^{n_i,n_j} \not\exists C : A\cdot B = C$. Obviously, two matrices times each other equals another matrix. However, what is important is the information we can represent. ?!?! Are they different???

What can complex linear nets do? This is somewhat inspired by the fact that transformations on quantum states is [linear](http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9801041.pdf). Also, quantum physics has some great math on path integrals, I wonder if we can use any of that?
