title: Can paths within neural nets lead to new insights?
category: problem
published: false

The number of paths in a neural net (vaugely explored in [Gated games](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01952) and [Loss surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0233)) increase exponentially in depth, but not in width. (I think) the number of additional operations (ie from the matmuls) remains the same for both. It would be nice to relate the number of paths to expressive power, i.e. something like [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03965).

Tensor - product captures this?
