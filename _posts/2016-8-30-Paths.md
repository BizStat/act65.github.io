title: Paths in linear networks
category: problem
---

I was just having a play with paths in neural nets (inspired by [Gated games](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01952) and [Loss surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0233) papers) and made some rather trivial observations, but maybe they are important?

The number of paths in the net increases exponentially in depth, but not in width. (I think) the number of additional operations (ie from the matmuls) remains the same for both. It would be nice to relate the number of paths to expressive power, i.e. something like [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03965).

I donâ€™t think it makes much sense to think about the paths in a linear net as they all just collapse back down to a single layer, so the number of paths is somewhat irrelevant. But I think that using complex numbers may change this??? (Like how some two-qubit states - described by complex numbers - can't be written as the tensor product of one-qubit states, e.g. the EPR pair).  Something about the way complex numbers can constructively/destructively interfere. 

Anyway, I am interested in purely linear nets, without non-linearities, as I am not sure they are necessary. This is somewhat inspired by the fact that transformations on quantum states is [linear](http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9801041.pdf). 

Quantum physics has some great math on path integrals, I wonder if we can use any of that?
