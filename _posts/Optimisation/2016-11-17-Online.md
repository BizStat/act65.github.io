General setting is that we have a set of experts who give us advice. We need to learn which ones give accurate and reliable advice so that we can use them for ...

### The halving algorithm

```python
def HalvingAlgol(experts,nature)
    for trail in range(Trials):
        y = [expert(x) for expert in Experts]
        prediction = round(sum(y)/N)
        target =
```
Wait: since binary search can be written as a recursive algol, can we do the same with the halving algorithm?

Would like a repo of simple/minimal problems solved with simple OCO algols
