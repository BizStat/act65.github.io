Optimisation is ... (a nice quote?)

<!-- Each section will derive gradient descent but start for different assumptions? -->

## Online optimisation

[Online optimisation]({{ baseurl }}/Online) is a new formulation of pattern detection and learning, as opposed to the commonly used statistical framework.

... ? expert advice.

<!--
Minimax â€¦
The cool things. A partial derivative in game theory.

* mechanism design

## Search

A general look at [search]({{ baseurl }}/Search), its relation to sorting.

Sorting is especially interesting when you view it from the point of view ... (Hashing, ?, ... . Hierarchical. Chunking and ?) Data structures!



## Dynamical systems


Optimisation can also be viewed as a [dynamical process]({{ baseurl }}/Dynamical).



## Sampling and integration

Want to approximate a distribution so we can find minima. Distribution is intractable...

* Calculus of variations. (this may end up being closely related to some of the stuff in dynamical systems)
