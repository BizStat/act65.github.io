GANs are a pain in the ass to train (speaking from experience). Neural networks can be sensitive to initialisations and learning rates, and GANs add yet another layer to the tower of cards.

While my GAN was frustratingly not working

Maybe we can borrow ideas from dynamical systems to help control our system.
