Can borrow ideas from dynamical systems to help control our system?

GANs are a pain in the ass to train (speaking from experience). Neural networks can be sensitive to initialisations and learning rates, and GANs add yet another layer to the tower of cards.

What about DynaGAN?

Inspired by the

$$
\begin{align}
&\textbf{GAN} \\
\mathcal{L}_{Forger} &= -log(1-fake) - log(real) \\
\mathcal{L}_{Curator} &= -log(fake) \\
\end{align}
$$
